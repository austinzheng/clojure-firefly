# clojure-firefly

A lightweight personal blog and link curation engine, implemented in (surprise) Clojure.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 1.7.0 or above installed.

As well, you need a default instance of Redis running on the local machine. The exact configuration may change as development continues.
