# clojure-blog

A super basic playground for experimenting with Clojure and web applications. If given enough time, it may eventually become a blog/personal site engine.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 1.7.0 or above installed.

As well, you need a default instance of Redis running on the local machine. The exact configuration may change as development continues.

## Running

    lein ring server
