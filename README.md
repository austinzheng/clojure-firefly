# clojure-firefly

A lightweight personal blog and link curation engine, implemented in (surprise) Clojure.

## Features

- Lightweight blog
- View a single entry, a page of entries, or an compact 'archive' list of blog entries
- For adding, removing or editing entries, built-in blog post editor with preview functionality
- Add tags to blog posts; click on a tag to show all posts with that tag
- Log in as administrator to manage blog
- Redis as storage engine - easy backups, high performance

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 1.7.0 or above installed.

As well, you need a default instance of Redis running on the local machine. The exact configuration may change as development continues.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server

## To Be Done

### Technical

- Figure out why save "fails" occasionally first time after inactivity (may have to do with "1 changes in 3600 seconds" autosave on Redis' end...)
- Persistent sessions and better session security
- Add a system for logging error or warning data to a file

### Features

- Less eye-bleedingly ugly CSS and HTML
- Saving draft posts
- About page
- Curated links feature
- Smart image support (support for uploading and deleting images in blog post editor, thumbnail previews)
- Possible comment support (or use a third-party solution)
